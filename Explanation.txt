~-~-~ Pyber ~-~-~

\nPyber is a look at a fictional ride sharing company. The point of this exercise was to read in CSV data and output graphs to represent different aspects of the company.

\nThe code is written in Python, the file is that of Jupyter Notebook. If you do not have Jupyter Notebook installed on your computer, do not hesitate to download the file as .txt or other format and save into a seperate .py file.

\nThe outputs of the three graphs will print and save into the folder "Figures" for later use.

\nThis code is an example of using Python, Pandas, and Matplotlib to manipulate and display the data.
